## Project Summary

Our project will involve one model:
1. The first model will allow us to classify the political bias present in a sentence. This model will be trained on a data set containing sentences labeled liberal or conservative, and ultimately output a number on a scale of -1 to 1. We are using a transformer to reflect and process text snippets and output the political bias/sentiment of a certain text. 

## Dataset
We plan to use this dataset of posts from conservative and liberal subreddited labeled by the source(liberal/conservative). We encountered some bias and leanings towards more negative sentiment titles, so  pre-processing and ensuring a good spread of data was crucial to the success of the project. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neelgajare/liberals-vs-conservatives-on-reddit-13000-posts?resource=download
